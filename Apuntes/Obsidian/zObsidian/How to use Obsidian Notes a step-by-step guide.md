## What is the Obsidian Notes app?

Obsidian is an aesthetically beautiful, powerful Markdown-based note taking app that was originally launched in 2020 by programmers [Erica Xu](https://ericaxu.com/) and [Shida Li](https://ca.linkedin.com/in/lishid) (the talented team who also created [Dynalist](http://www.dynalist.io/)). Like so many note-taking enthusiasts, Erica felt frustrated by the state of note taking apps, and wanted something that was a better fit.

In the words of the Obsidian Notes team from their [About page](https://obsidian.md/about):

> Why build yet another note-taking app? Like the cliché goes, we started Obsidian because Erica couldn’t find anything that can satisfy her need to build a personal knowledge base. She has tried all kinds of software from TiddlyWiki to TheBrain; nothing felt right though. Quarantine finally gave us the chance to start making it.

Obsidian has three fundamental features:

-   **Plain text** (with Markdown support) is the default format
-   **Links** (including bidirectional links aka backlinks) are first-class citizens
-   Designed to be **highly extensible** (to include plugins, themes, etc) and customizable

**Those three features make Obsidian simultaneously incredibly powerful… and potentially a bit daunting to use.** There are endless possibilities and customizations available— which can easily lead to analysis paralysis.

In this quick-start guide, we’ll go over just the essentials you need to get your note taking system up and running in Obsidian. You can tweak and extend and explore further functionality later… the important thing is taking that first step.

___

## Cross-platform availability for Obsidian Notes

One of the reasons that I recommend Obsidian as one of the [best note taking apps](https://elizabethbutlermd.com/7-best-note-taking-apps-personal-knowledge-management/) currently available is that it has great cross-platform availability.

[![](https://cdn.getmidnight.com/de7a8f7c083abf41a583073d8704ea72/2022/09/image-9.png)](http://www.obsidian.md/download)

### Mac, Windows, Linux

Obsidian currently has [dedicated desktop apps available for Windows, Mac, and Linux](https://obsidian.md/download).

### Mobile apps for iOS and Android

Obsidian also offers [mobile apps](https://obsidian.md/mobile), available for both [iOS and Android](https://obsidian.md/mobile), so you can access your personal knowledge management system on the go. The iOS version works on both iPhone and iPad.

### Is Obsidian a free note taking app? Obsidian Notes pricing details

The Obsidian desktop apps and mobile apps are all 100% free for personal use. There’s an annual fee for commercial use, and they also offer a “Catalyst” tier for Obsidian enthusiasts to offer support to the team and get early access to new features.

#### Obsidian Sync

Obsidian offers a [paid, premium, encrypted sync option](https://obsidian.md/sync), which automatically keeps files in sync on mobile devices. Premium Obsidian Sync isn’t required, but is the most comprehensive option for keeping vaults synced across both desktop and mobile devices. Check out their FAQ for [other Obsidian syncing options](https://help.obsidian.md/Getting+started/Sync+your+notes+across+devices).

___

## Who is Obsidian best for?

I highly recommend Obsidian as a lightweight, extensible, [future-proof note taking app](https://elizabethbutlermd.com/how-to-take-future-proof-notes/), given its cross-platform availability. It’s especially well-suited to:

-   Programmers
-   University students
-   Graduate students
-   Academics
-   Researchers
-   Writers

💸

It's also great for anyone looking for a note taking app on a budget, since the basic features are completely free.

___

## Markdown (.MD files) and Obsidian

Obsidian is software that collects and organizes plain-text files saved in [Markdown format](https://elizabethbutlermd.com/5-reasons-why-markdown-could-be-your-secret-weapon-for-effortless-personal-knowledge-management/). This guide goes over the basic syntax of [Markdown formatting](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/)— if you know any HTML, you'll quickly feel comfortable with Markdown.

A major advantage of Obsidian using Markdown files rather than proprietary formats is that any personal knowledge base you build in Obsidian is [future proof](https://elizabethbutlermd.com/how-to-take-future-proof-notes/). You can simply move your Markdown notes to another editor, or even search and browse and open them as plain text. There’s no problem if you move from Windows to Mac to Linux.

## Getting started with Obsidian: how to create a note taking system in Obsidian

### Step one: download and install the Obsidian app

Download the latest version of the Obsidian desktop app for your chosen platform at [Obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md/download). Install the app on your local system.

### Step two: choose where to save your vault

The first time you open the app, you’ll be asked to **choose a vault**.

![](https://cdn.getmidnight.com/de7a8f7c083abf41a583073d8704ea72/2022/09/image.png)

Simply put, an “[Obsidian Vault](https://help.obsidian.md/Getting+started/Create+a+vault)” is a folder on your local file system (or if you like, in your [Dropbox](https://help.obsidian.md/Getting+started/Sync+your+notes+across+devices)) where Obsidian collects and stores your notes. You can keep all your notes in one vault, or create multiple different vaults-- it's entirely up to your preferences.

You can choose a vault by clicking through and selecting the folder where you’d like your collection of Markdown files to reside.

![](https://cdn.getmidnight.com/de7a8f7c083abf41a583073d8704ea72/2022/09/image-1.png)

### Step three: choose your theme

Everyone has a preference between light and dark themes. Obsidian comes set to a dark theme out of the box, but you can easily change it to a light theme if that’s your preference:

1.  Head to **Settings** (the gear on the bottom left side).
2.  Choose the **Appearance** tab.
3.  Select your **preferred base theme** (light or dark).
4.  You can also explore other **community themes** by clicking the Themes -> “Manage” button in this setting.

![](https://cdn.getmidnight.com/de7a8f7c083abf41a583073d8704ea72/2022/09/image-6.png)

![](https://cdn.getmidnight.com/de7a8f7c083abf41a583073d8704ea72/2022/09/image-7.png)

### Step four: set up your folders

Your new vault might be looking a little empty.

![](https://cdn.getmidnight.com/de7a8f7c083abf41a583073d8704ea72/2022/09/image-2.png)

Within Obsidian, you can choose to create some file structure to organize your notes. You’re not obligated to do this— you can choose to rely entirely on [backlinks](https://help.obsidian.md/How+to/Working+with+backlinks) or [tags](https://help.obsidian.md/How+to/Working+with+tags), but many people appreciate having the option to structure their notes using folders.

To create a folder:

1.  Click on the “New Folder” button on the upper left side, in the File Explorer tab.
2.  Name your folder.
3.  The folders automatically sort by name alphabetically.

![](https://cdn.getmidnight.com/de7a8f7c083abf41a583073d8704ea72/2022/09/image-4.png)

### Step five: create a new note and start capturing

To create a new note:

1.  Press “**Ctrl+N**” (Windows) or “**Cmd+N**” (macOS) on your keyboard. Or, **click on the “New Note” button** on the upper left side, in the File Explorer tab.
2.  Enter your note name in the top (the note will be saved as “your-note-name.md” on your computer).
3.  Type your note, adding Markdown formatting if you like. You can make nested bullets, lists, add headers, highlight text, and bold text. Check out this [help guide on formatting your notes in Obsidian](https://help.obsidian.md/How+to/Format+your+notes) for more instructions.

![](https://cdn.getmidnight.com/de7a8f7c083abf41a583073d8704ea72/2022/09/image-17.png)

### Step six: organize your notes

You can drag and drop your notes in Obsidian to put them in your preferred folder. You click and hold your note title on the left hand side, then drag it to a folder.

![](https://cdn.getmidnight.com/de7a8f7c083abf41a583073d8704ea72/2022/09/image-14.png)

If you're not a folder fan, Obsidian also allows you to [organize notes by tags](https://help.obsidian.md/Plugins/Tag+pane) and through bidirectional linking (keep reading below for more on linking notes in Obsidian).

📓

Trying to decide on the best way to organize your notes? Wish you could build a sustainable personal knowledge system to finally organize all those notes and ideas you have scattered across your email, Google Docs, Pinterest, Notion, and your hard drive? The [Calmer Notes method for personal knowledge management](https://elizabethbutlermd.com/simplify-your-digital-note-taking-workflow-how-to-build-a-minimalist-personal-knowledge-management-system-with-the-calmer-notes-method/) is a step-by-step framework to help you build a customized, fully tailored information management system that fits your life.

## Key features in Obsidian

### Backlinks & bidirectional linking: how to link your notes together in Obsidian

Backlinks (aka bidirectional linking) is a key feature of Obsidian. As the [Obsidian user guide](https://help.obsidian.md/Getting+started/Link+notes) notes:

> While Obsidian is great for taking notes, the true power of Obsidian lies in being able to link your notes together. By understanding how one piece of information relates to another, you can improve your ability to remember them and to form deeper insights.

#### How to add a link to an existing note in Obsidian

1.  Press the **left square bracket twice on your keyboard (\[\[)**.
2.  Choose the note you’d like to link to from the drop-down menu.

![](https://cdn.getmidnight.com/de7a8f7c083abf41a583073d8704ea72/2022/09/image-12.png)

#### How to add a link to a new note in Obsidian

1.  Highlight your chosen text.
2.  Press the **left square bracket twice on your keyboard (\[\[)**.
3.  A new note with that name (i.e. your chosen, highlighted text) is automatically created.

![](https://cdn.getmidnight.com/de7a8f7c083abf41a583073d8704ea72/2022/09/image-13.png)

### Searching your Obsidian notes vault

Once you’ve added a few notes to your vault, you’ll want the ability to search through your old content.

![](https://cdn.getmidnight.com/de7a8f7c083abf41a583073d8704ea72/2022/09/image-15.png)

  
Here's how to search through your notes in Obsidian:

1.  Press **Ctrl+Shift+F** (Windows) or **Cmd+Shift+F** (Mac) on your keyboard. Or, click the **“Search” button** on the upper left side, next to the File Explorer tab.

You can use a [number of advanced search operators within Obsidian](https://help.obsidian.md/Plugins/Search) to find precisely what you’re searching for.

___

## Extending and customising Obsidian with plugins and themes

A huge part of why Obsidian is so popular these days is that it offers nearly endless customization options. You can adjust the appearance, add plugins with extra functionality, and integrate it with many other apps.

It can feel easy to get overwhelmed when exploring plugins and extensions– don't feel obliged to install plugins just because they look interesting and other people enjoy them. **Make sure that you're mindfully choosing extensions and plugins that truly match with your own [note taking goals](https://elizabethbutlermd.com/best-way-to-take-notes-goals/).**

⭐

Be sure to start with [system, not software](https://elizabethbutlermd.com/why-system-matters-more-than-software-for-organizing-your-digital-notes/), to build a truly sustainable note taking system in Obsidian (or any other app).

📓

Want to build a mindful, intentional note taking system? Tired of trying over and over again to make your personal knowledge management workflow fit into someone else's cookie-cutter advice? The [Calmer Notes method](https://elizabethbutlermd.com/simplify-your-digital-note-taking-workflow-how-to-build-a-minimalist-personal-knowledge-management-system-with-the-calmer-notes-method/) for personal knowledge management walks you through a step-by-step framework to mindfully craft a completely customized, tailored note taking system aligned with your own unique goals.

### Obsidian plugins

#### Core plugins

Obsidian comes with a number of [core plugins](https://help.obsidian.md/Plugins/Core+plugins) built in as options within your default installation. To activate these, go to **Settings —> Core Plugins**, then toggle on and off your preferred core plugins.

![](https://cdn.getmidnight.com/de7a8f7c083abf41a583073d8704ea72/2022/09/image-18.png)

[Community plugins](https://help.obsidian.md/Advanced+topics/Community+plugins) are designed by developers outside the Obsidian team. This means that they do carry a higher security risk than the core plugins. To use community plugins, you have to opt-in to allow them.

To access community plugins, go to **Settings —> Community plugins**, then choose "**Turn on community plugins**" at the bottom of the popup window.

![](https://cdn.getmidnight.com/de7a8f7c083abf41a583073d8704ea72/2022/09/image-19.png)

Once you've turned on community plugins, you'll have the option to search and browse through the list of hundreds of plugins.
